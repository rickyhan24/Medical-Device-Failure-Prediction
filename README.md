# Medical-Device-Failure-Prediction
In this case study, I perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset consisting of daily aggregated
device telemetry readings to identify the most significant attributes of the data. Secondly, I apply
several classification models and identify the best-performing models in regard to accuracy, precision,
and recallâ€“with especial emphasis on recall due to the importance of identifying faulty medical
devices.
